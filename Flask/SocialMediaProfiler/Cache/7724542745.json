However, we give all the Love and respect to Ronaldo. He inspires us. Does anyone know what this he has done means? He is a Champion, he is a fighter. He had one Ballon D\u2019 Or, then Messi went on to have 4. He was broken at a time, as he always tried, but it wouldn\u2019t be. We all saw his tears when he had his second. He pressed on and had his third. Football was like, Catch Messi if you can as Messi had the 5th\u2026 now they are level. For Ronaldo to come on to level things up, it\u2019s so much determination, character and spirit. He is indeed an inspiration as some Footbalgerians expressed. Congratulations Ronaldo.\n.\n.\n.\nThe 30-Man Ballon D\u2019 Or Ranking\u2026 See where your player ranks:\n1. Cristiano Ronaldo Real Madrid\n2. Lionel Messi\n3. Neymar\n4. Gianluigi Buffon\n5.

De Gea showed why he should be there.\n- Liverpool ever has World Class players, only that they sell them [Wink]\n- We think Kevin De Bruyne will move further up next time, including Hazard, 2 Belgians, missing Lukaku.\n- Yeah\u2026 if Morata keeps up, Salah too, the next award will have all those we want in.

Ibrahimovic missed both matches due to a bit of fatigue following his return from a long-term knee injury. Jones has been sidelined since being away with England on international duty but is back in contention for a place in defence.\r\nFellaini, meanwhile, has been trying to shake off a knee problem, but the game has come too soon forEric BaillyandMichael Carrick, who remain sidelined.\r\nAsked by reporters about Sunday's clash, Mourinho said: \"I know that a derby is something special for the people. For us, in the end, it is three points but, honestly, I think that for the people born in the city and feeling the colours in that good positive rivalry, it is a special match.\r\n\"I think, in the right way, the derbies are a beautiful thing - same city, different colours, friends they support different colours and, even under the same roof in some families, they disagree on the passion for the colours.
